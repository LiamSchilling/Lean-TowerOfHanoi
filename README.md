# Tower of Hanoi

A formalization of the [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) game and its generalizations.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Construct the solution to the classic configuration of `n` blocks on `3` towers and prove that its length is `2 ^ n - 1` steps.
- [ ] Prove that any solution to the classic configuration of length less than `2 ^ n` steps is equal to the previous solution, thus showing that it is optimal.
